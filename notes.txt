original intro:
<p >
                Hello! I’m Paulo Oliveira, a 25-year-old web developer with a
                growing interest in mobile development. My passion lies in crafting
                beautiful and functional digital solutions that empower businesses
                and individuals to achieve their online goals.

            <p>
                Though I might be an introvert, I thrive on connecting with people
                and leveraging technology to tackle challenges. My journey in tech
                began at Rutgers University's web development bootcamp, where I
                graduated in August 2022. Currently, I'm honing my skills as a
                software engineer intern at Grads, a company dedicated to enhancing
                the e-commerce ecosystem for college students, making their academic
                experiences more convenient. At Grads, I've had the opportunity to
                contribute to the website’s development and take on various personal
                projects. One of my standout projects was the redesign of the Grads
                landing page, which stands as a testament to my dedication and
                creativity.

            <p>
                I hold honesty, hard work, and creativity as my core values, which
                guide me in building strong, enduring relationships with clients and
                consistently delivering exceptional work.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I’m eager to explore how we can
                connect and collaborate!

As a full-stack developer, I bring a comprehensive skill set to the
            table, covering both front-end and back-end aspects of web and mobile
            applications. My technical toolkit includes:
            
                <p>
                Front-end Development: Skilled in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, with
                expertise in creating responsive designs using Bootstrap and
                dynamic user interfaces with React.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                Back-end Development: Experienced in constructing robust
                server-side applications using Node.js and Express, and proficient
                in managing databases with MongoDB.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                Mobile Development: Actively developing my capabilities in mobile
                app development with React Native, managing both the front-end and
                back-end elements of projects.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    I take pride in using these technologies to develop polished,
                    professional websites and applications. My portfolio includes a
                    custom-built professional website and various other projects where I
                    have demonstrated my ability to manage and execute complex projects
                    efficiently.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    My role has expanded beyond traditional development into areas of
                    project management. Although not formally trained, I have gained
                    valuable perspective on managing projects by closely aligning with
                    client needs—particularly when working directly under the startup
                    founder at Grads. My responsibilities included overseeing the
                    project's vision, ensuring the design accurately reflected the
                    founder's vision, monitoring how the front-end brought this design
                    to life, and coordinating how the backend should respond to the
                    front-end's requirements.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Currently, I am enriching my skill set by working as a tutor at The
                    Coder School, where I teach coding to children using Scratch and
                    Python. This role has been particularly rewarding, pushing me to
                    quickly adapt and effectively communicate complex technical concepts
                    to young learners.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    In addition to my development and teaching roles, I am dedicated to
                    deepening my understanding of Python to integrate more automation
                    and data-driven features into my future projects. This continuous
                    learning underscores my commitment to staying at the forefront of
                    technology and adapting to the ever-evolving digital landscape.
